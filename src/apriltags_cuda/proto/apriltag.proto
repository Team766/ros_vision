    /* Quaternion representation of rotation.
    Quaternions are a compact representation of a 3D rotation matrix.
    They are really interesting as you can basically represent 9 numbers (from a 3x3 matrix)
    with just 4 quaternion components.  As such they are used in many applications where
    you might be bandwidth constrained but need to send rotation information.  I like to think of
    them as an axis-angle representation where the qx/qy/qz define the axis and the qw (scalar) 
    defines the angle.  here is the wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation
    And here is a great video explaining quaternions: https://eater.net/quaternions/video/intro
